# Blue Blooded

A remake of Kingdom Come: Deliverance('s Skalitz chapter) in text based form for a school project.

Will eventually include combat, dialogue and some form of freedom around the village. May end up becoming my framework, or a baseline inspiration for future text based products I hope to create.

This is a mostly solo project, so any contributions may very likely not be considered and committed. I plan to do this almost completely by myself until the game reaches a state I'm happy with.
