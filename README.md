# Blue Blooded
THIS IS A PROTOTYPE

A remake of Kingdom Come: Deliverance('s Skalitz chapter) in text based form for a school project.

Will eventually include combat, dialogue and some form of freedom around the village. May end up becoming my framework, or a baseline inspiration for future text based products I hope to create.

Currently not implement are "dice roll" based combat, true interaction with NPCs, stats and skill (defense doesn't do anything yet), etc.
The product here is a skeleton, and a base of inspiration for future products, and potentially a finished version of this project. Will require a complete code overhaul in order to achieve a proper state of playability.

During this journey I've learned a lot about game design, how to load assets like objects, and character. I did it completely wrong here but I can use this new knowledge for future games I may or may not make. So at least there's a silver lining!
